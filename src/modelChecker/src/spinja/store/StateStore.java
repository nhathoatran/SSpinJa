/**
 * A StateStore is used to store state, which are encoded as byte arrays. The goal of the StateStore
 * is to be able to tell if a state was already stored. This answer can be retrieved when adding a
 * state through the {@link #addState(byte[])} method.
 * 
 * The StateStore does not have to be perfect, in the sense that false positives are allowed. When
 * this state thinks that a state was not seen yet, when it has in fact been seen, it may return a
 * false positive. This makes the search less efficient, but not wrong. False negatives though, are
 * not recommended, because then the search may not be complete.
